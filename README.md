# musimathics_project

This project proposes the development of an automatic tablature composer based on Genetic Algorithms (GA) implemented in Python, utilizing the Music21 library for the symbolic manipulation of musical structures. Experimental results are presented through both graphical tablature visualization and audio playback functionality, allowing for immediate auditory verification of the optimized fingering's musical coherence.
