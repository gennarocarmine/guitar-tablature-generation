# Guitar Tablature Generation (GTG)

This project for the Musimathics course at the University of Salerno (UNISA) proposes the development of an automatic tablature composer based on Genetic Algorithms (GA), implemented in Python and using the music21 library for symbolic manipulation of musical structures. Experimental results are presented through graphical tablature visualization and audio playback, allowing immediate auditory verification of the optimized fingering's musical coherence.
